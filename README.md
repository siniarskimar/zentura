# Zentura

Code editor made from scratch for personal challenge and educational purposes.

This editor is expected to:

 - Be standalone application (GUI application)
 - Be a modal editor with Kakoune inspired keybindings
 - Have sane defaults that do not require extensive configuration
 - Treesitter and LSP support
