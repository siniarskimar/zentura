# Zentura

Code editor made from scratch.

[Why do I do this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oNgyUAEv0Q)
On more serious note, this project is a personal challenge of mine.

This editor is expected to:

 - Be standalone application (GUI application)
 - Be a modal editor with Kakoune inspired keybindings
 - Have sane defaults that do not require extensive configuration
 - Treesitter and LSP support
 - Support plugins
